  # The open cell (or cells) in the puzzle’s start state. NOTE: It should be possible to create an initial
  # state with one or more holes. There for add config for all holes location (row, column).

Critic:
  # Critic using table lookup or neural network

  # Learning rate critic
  # When the critic uses a neural network, it is often wise to have a much lower learning rate for the critic than for the actor.
